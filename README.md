A multipe-choice guessing game about basketball. Once the user clicks the "Jump Ball" button, they are presented with a list of questions. They then have 24 seconds to answer all of them and hit the "Slam Dunk" button. Either when the user hits the "Slam Dunk" button, or the timer runs out, they are presented with their results.
